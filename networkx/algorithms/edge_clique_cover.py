def minimum_edge_clique_cover(G):
    """
    Find exact clique-minimum edge clique cover of simple undirected graph G.

    An *edge clique cover* (ECC) of a graph G is a collection of its cliques
    (fully connected subgraphs) whose union contains all edges in G. A
    *clique-minimum ECC* is and ECC with the minimum possible cliques. The
    cardinality of such an ECC is known as the *intersection number* of G.
    This implemenatation is based on [1]_, which has complexity
    :math:`O(f(2^k) + n^4)`, where :math:`k` is the number of cliques in the
    solution and :math:`n` is the number of nodes in G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        G must be simple and undirected

    Returns
    -------
    the_cover: set of sets
